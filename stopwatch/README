A simple stopwatch, configured by  YAML files.

Usage:
    ./stopwatch.rb <yaml_file>

yaml_file is a simple configuration file in the following format:

<hour>: <text>

OR

<hour>:
  text: <text>
  color: <color>

For example, imagine you want to, at 10 minutes, display a message
like "show slides 10 to 20", and at 20 minutes, change the color of
the stopwatch. You can use the following YAML:

00:10: show slides 10 to 20
00:20:
  color: blue

Enjoy!
